We may use these, for example, when modelling observations taken over time on students who are grouped into classes that are grouped into schools that are grouped into districts. If each of the distributions of the random effects is Gaussian and if the disturbance term at the lowest level of grouping is also Gaussian it is straightforward to define a likelihood for the fixed effects and the parameters defining the random effects distribution. We show that by expressing the random effects distribution in terms of relative precision factors and using matrix decompositions, this likelihood can be profiled and can be compactly expressed. The same decompositions provide rapid evaluation of the profiled log-restricted-likelihood for REML estimation.},

The FvCB model was modified by adding a sub-model for Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) activation and validating the parameters for temperature dependency of Vcmax and Jmax. Values of parameters for temperature dependency of Vcmax and Jmax were validated and adjusted based on data of the photosynthesis response to temperature. Parameter estimation was based on measurements under a wide range of environmental conditions, providing parameters with broad validity. The simultaneous estimation method and the nonlinear mixed effects model were applied to ensure the accuracy of the parameter estimation. The FvCB parameters, Vcmax, Jmax, \k{} (the efficiency of light energy conversion), \^A (the curvature of light response of electron transport), and Rd (the non-photorespiratory CO2 release) were estimated and validated on a dataset from two other years. Observations and predictions matched well (R2 = 0.94). We conclude that incorporating a sub-model of Rubisco activation improved the FvCB model through predicting light dependency of carboxylation rate; and that estimating Vcmax, Jmax, \k, \^A, and Rd requires data sets of both CO2 and light response curves.},

  abstract = {\textdagger{} Background and Aims Plants use diffuse light more efficiently than direct light. However, experimental comparisons between diffuse and direct light have been obscured by co-occurring differences in environmental conditions (e.g. light intensity). This study aims to analyse the factors that contribute to an increase in crop photosynthesis in diffuse light and to quantify their relative contribution under different levels of diffuseness at similar light intensities. The hypothesis is that the enhancement of crop photosynthesis in diffuse light results not only from the direct effects of more uniform vertical and horizontal light distribution in the crop canopy, but also from crop physiological and morphological acclimation. \textdagger{} Methods Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) crops were grown in three greenhouse compartments that were covered by glass with different degrees of light diffuseness (0, 45 and 71 \% of the direct light being converted into diffuse light) while maintaining similar light transmission. Measurements of horizontal and vertical photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) distribution in the crop, leaf photosynthesis light response curves and leaf area index (LAI) were used to quantify each factor's contribution to an increase in crop photosynthesis in diffuse light. In addition, leaf temperature, photoinhibition, and leaf biochemical and anatomical properties were studied. \textdagger{} Key Results The highest degree of light diffuseness (71 \%) increased the calculated crop photosynthesis by 7.2 \%. This effect was mainly attributed to a more uniform horizontal (33 \% of the total effect) and vertical PPFD distribution (21 \%) in the crop. In addition, plants acclimated to the high level of diffuseness by gaining a higher photosynthetic capacity of leaves in the middle of the crop and a higher LAI, which contributed 23 and 13 \%, respectively, to the total increase in crop photosynthesis in diffuse light. Moreover, diffuse light resulted in lower leaf temperatures and less photoinhibition at the top of the canopy when global irradiance was high. \textdagger{} Conclusions Diffuse light enhanced crop photosynthesis. A more uniform horizontal PPFD distribution played the most important role in this enhancement, and a more uniform vertical PPFD distribution and higher leaf photosynthetic capacity contributed more to the enhancement of crop photosynthesis than did higher values of LAI.},

Methods for fitting a model to such data are briefly described. The method will fit the following parameters: Vcmax, J, TPU, Rd and gm [maximum carboxylation rate allowed by ribulose 1$\cdot$5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), rate of photosynthetic electron transport (based on NADPH requirement), triose phosphate use, day respiration and mesophyll conductance, respectively]. The method requires at least five data pairs of net CO2 assimilation (A) and [CO2] in the intercellular airspaces of the leaf (Ci) and requires users to indicate the presumed limiting factor. The output is (1) calculated CO2 partial pressure at the sites of carboxylation, Cc, (2) values for the five parameters at the measurement temperature and (3) values adjusted to 25 $^\circ$C to facilitate comparisons. Fitting this model is a way of exploring leaf level photosynthesis. However, interpreting leaf level photosynthesis in terms of underlying biochemistry and biophysics is subject to assumptions that hold to a greater or lesser degree, a major assumption being that all parts of the leaf are behaving in the same way at each instant.},

However, estimations of average gm by these methods are often unreliable either because the range of usable data is too narrow or because the estimations are very sensitive to measurement errors. We describe three method variants to estimate gm, for which a wider range of data are usable. They use curve-fitting techniques, which minimise the sum of squared model deviations from the data for A (CO2 assimilation rate) or for J (linear electron transport rate). Like the existing approaches, they are all based on common physiological principles assuming that electron transport limits A. The proposed variants were far less sensitive than the existing approaches to `measurement noise' either created randomly in the generated data set or inevitably existing in real data sets. Yet, the estimates of gm from the three variants differed by approximately 15\%. Moreover, for each variant, a stoichiometric uncertainty in linear electron transport-limited photosynthesis can cause another 15\% difference. Any estimation of gm using gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements should be considered with caution, especially when gm is high.},

  abstract = {Mesophyll diffusion conductance to CO2 (gm) is an important leaf characteristic determining the drawdown of CO2 from substomatal cavities (Ci) to chloroplasts (CC). Finite gm results in modifications in the shape of the net assimilation (A) versus Ci response curves, with the final outcome of reduced maximal carboxylase activity of Rubisco (Vcmax), and a greater ratio of the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport to Vcmax (Jmax/Vcmax) and alterations in mitochondrial respiration rate (Rd) when estimated from A/Ci responses without considering gm. The influence of different Farquhar et al. model parameterizations on daily photosynthesis under non-stressed (Ci kept constant throughout the day) and stressed conditions (mid-day reduction in Ci) was compared. The model was parameterized on the basis of A/CC curves and A/Ci curves using both the conventional fitting procedure (Vcmax and Rd fitted separately to the linear part of the response curve and Jmax to the saturating part) and a procedure that fitted all parameters simultaneously. The analyses demonstrated that A/Ci parameterizations overestimated daily assimilation by 6\textendash{}8\% for high gm values, while they underestimated if by up to 70\% for low gm values. Qualitative differences between the A/Ci and A/CC parameterizations were observed under stressed conditions, when underestimated Vcmax and overestimated Rd of A/Ci parameterizations resulted in excessive mid-day depression of photosynthesis. Comparison with measured diurnal assimilation rates in the Mediterranean sclerophyll species Quercus ilex under drought further supported this bias of A/Ci parameterizations. While A/Ci parameterization predicted negative carbon balance at mid-day, actual measurements and simulations with the A/CC approach yielded positive carbon gain under these conditions. In addition, overall variation captured by the best A/Ci parameterization was poor compared with the A/CC approach. This analysis strongly suggests that for correct parameterization of daily time-courses of photosynthesis under realistic field conditions, gm must be included in photosynthesis models.},

Then, recent studies approaching non-uniform photosynthesis are reviewed. After examining techniques for the detection of non-uniform photosynthesis or non-uniform stomatal aperture, results of the relevant studies are discussed for respective stress factors, seeking causes and consequences of non-uniform photosynthesis. From these, mechanisms responsible for, and consequences of non-uniform photosynthesis, are considered. The problems which should be challenged are also pointed out.},

  volume = {78},
  abstract = {The PhOtosynthetic capacity of leaves is related to the nitrogen content primarily because the proteins of the Calvin cycle and thylakoids represent the majority of leaf nitrogen. To a first approximation, thylakoid nitrogen is proportional to the chlorophyll content (50 mol thylakoid N mol- \textasciitilde{} Chl). Within species there are strong linear relationships between nitrogen and both RuBP carboxylase and chlorophyll. With increasing nitrogen per unit leaf area, the proportion of total leaf nitrogen in the thylakoids remains the same while the proportion in soluble protein increases. In many species, growth under lower irradiance greatly increases the partitioning of nitrogen into chlorophyll and the thylakoids, while the electron transport capacity per unit of chlorophyll declines. If growth irradiance influences the relationship between photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen content, predicting nitrogen distribution between leaves in a canopy becomes more complicated. When both photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen content are expressed on the basis of leaf area, considerable variation in the photosynthetic capacity for a given leaf nitrogen content is found between species. The variation reflects different strategies of nitrogen partitioning, the electron transport capacity per unit of chlorophyll and the specific activity of RuBP carboxylase. Survival in certain environments clearly does not require maximising photosynthetic capacity for a given leaf nitrogen content. Species that flourish in the shade partition relatively more nitrogen into the thylakoids, although this is associated with lower photosynthetic capacity per unit of nitrogen.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of protein subcellular localization assists in the elucidation of protein function and understanding of different biological mechanisms that occur at discrete subcellular niches. Organelle-centric proteomics enables localization of thousands of proteins simultaneously. Although such techniques have successfully allowed organelle protein catalogues to be achieved, they rely on the purification or significant enrichment of the organelle of interest, which is not achievable for many organelles. Incomplete separation of organelles leads to false discoveries, with erroneous assignments. Proteomics methods that measure the distribution patterns of specific organelle markers along density gradients are able to assign proteins of unknown localization based on comigration with known organelle markers, without the need for organelle purification. These methods are greatly enhanced when coupled to sophisticated computational tools. Here we apply and compare multiple approaches to establish a high-confidence data set of Arabidopsis root tissue trans-Golgi network (TGN) proteins. The method employed involves immunoisolations of the TGN, coupled to probability-based organelle proteomics techniques. Specifically, the technique known as LOPIT (localization of organelle protein by isotope tagging), couples density centrifugation with quantitative mass-spectometry-based proteomics using isobaric labeling and targeted methods with semisupervised machine learning methods. We demonstrate that while the immunoisolation method gives rise to a significant data set, the approach is unable to distinguish cargo proteins and persistent contaminants from full-time residents of the TGN. The LOPIT approach, however, returns information about many subcellular niches simultaneously and the steady-state location of proteins. Importantly, therefore, it is able to dissect proteins present in more than one organelle and cargo proteins en route to other cellular destinations from proteins whose steady-state location favors the TGN. Using this approach, we present a robust list of Arabidopsis TGN proteins.},

Accordingly, modifying the disease-related subcellular mislocalization of proteins might be an attractive means of therapeutic intervention. In particular, cellular processes that link protein folding and cell signaling, as well as nuclear import and export, to the subcellular localization of proteins have been proposed as targets for therapeutic intervention. We discuss the concepts involved in the therapeutic restoration of disrupted physiological protein localization and therapeutic mislocalization as a strategy to inactivate disease-causing proteins.},

  abstract = {Background: Eukaryotic cells contain numerous compartments, which have different protein constituents. Proteins are typically directed to compartments by short peptide sequences that act as targeting signals. Translocation to the proper compartment allows a protein to form the necessary interactions with its partners and take part in biological networks such as signalling and metabolic pathways. If a protein is not transported to the correct intracellular compartment either the reaction performed or information carried by the protein does not reach the proper site, causing either inactivation of central reactions or misregulation of signalling cascades, or the mislocalized active protein has harmful effects by acting in the wrong place.
Results: Numerous methods have been developed to predict protein subcellular localization with quite high accuracy. We applied bioinformatics methods to investigate the effects of known diseaserelated mutations on protein targeting and localization by analyzing over 22,000 missense mutations in more than 1,500 proteins with two complementary prediction approaches. Several hundred putative localization affecting mutations were identified and investigated statistically.
Conclusion: Although alterations to localization signals are rare, these effects should be taken into account when analyzing the consequences of disease-related mutations.},

We show that the levels of transcripts and proteins correlate significantly for only about half of the genes tested, with an average correlation of 0.27, and the correlations of transcripts and proteins varied depending on the cellular location and biological function of the gene. We examined technical and biological factors that could contribute to the modest correlation. For example, differential splicing clearly affects the analyses for certain genes; but, based on deep sequencing, this does not substantially contribute to the overall estimate of the correlation. We also employed genome-wide association analyses to map loci controlling both transcript and protein levels. Surprisingly, little overlap was observed between the protein- and transcriptmapped loci. We have typed numerous clinically relevant traits among the strains, including adiposity, lipoprotein levels, and tissue parameters. Using correlation analysis, we found that a low number of clinical trait relationships are preserved between the protein and mRNA gene products and that the majority of such relationships are specific to either the protein levels or transcript levels. Surprisingly, transcript levels were more strongly correlated with clinical traits than protein levels. In light of the widespread use of high-throughput technologies in both clinical and basic research, the results presented have practical as well as basic implications.},

  abstract = {Analysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of vital importance to fully understand context specific protein function. Some proteins can be found with a single location within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) based spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles. However, such methods fail to quantify uncertainty associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate the framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a Bayesian generative classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically to sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations, with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics. Our framework is flexible, allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods perform competitively with current state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing more information. We highlight several examples where classification based on the support vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using our approach provides biologically intriguing results.

  abstract = {Motivation: The integration of multiple datasets remains a key challenge in systems biology and genomic medicine. Modern highthroughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct\textemdash{}but often complementary\textemdash{}information. We present a Bayesian method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets, which we refer to as MDI (Multiple Dataset Integration). MDI can integrate information from a wide range of different datasets and data types simultaneously (including the ability to model time series data explicitly using Gaussian processes). Each dataset is modelled using a Dirichlet-multinomial allocation (DMA) mixture model, with dependencies between these models captured through parameters that describe the agreement among the datasets. Results: Using a set of six artificially constructed time series datasets, we show that MDI is able to integrate a significant number of datasets simultaneously, and that it successfully captures the underlying structural similarity between the datasets. We also analyse a variety of real Saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets. In the two-dataset case, we show that MDI's performance is comparable with the present state-of-the-art. We then move beyond the capabilities of current approaches and integrate gene expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation\textendash{}chip and protein\textendash{}protein interaction data, to identify a set of protein complexes for which genes are co-regulated during the cell cycle. Comparisons to other unsupervised data integration techniques\textemdash{}as well as to non-integrative approaches\textemdash{}demonstrate that MDI is competitive, while also providing information that would be difficult or impossible to extract using other methods.},

In this Commentary, we give a brief overview of the different mechanisms that are involved in protein trafficking and describe how aberrant localization of proteins contributes to the pathogenesis of many human diseases, such as metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as cancer. Accordingly, modifying the disease-related subcellular mislocalization of proteins might be an attractive means of therapeutic intervention. In particular, cellular processes that link protein folding and cell signaling, as well as nuclear import and export, to the subcellular localization of proteins have been proposed as targets for therapeutic intervention. We discuss the concepts involved in the therapeutic restoration of disrupted physiological protein localization and therapeutic mislocalization as a strategy to inactivate disease-causing proteins.},

Using both approaches we highlight suborganellar resolution and isoform-specific subcellular niches as well as the locations of large protein complexes and proteins involved in signalling pathways which play important roles in cancer and metabolism.

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

We present a unique transfer learning classification framework that utilises a nearest-neighbour or support vector machine system, to integrate heterogeneous data sources to considerably improve on the quantity and quality of sub-cellular protein assignment. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithms through evaluation of five experimental datasets, from four different species in conjunction with four different auxiliary data sources to classify proteins to tens of sub-cellular compartments with high generalisation accuracy. We further apply the method to an experiment on pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells to classify a set of previously unknown proteins, and validate our findings against a recent high resolution map of the mouse stem cell proteome. The methodology is distributed as part of the open-source Bioconductor pRoloc suite for spatial proteomics data analysis.},

The norms of theforward operators associated with the corresponding nonreversible Markov chains are used to discriminate among different simulation schemes. When applied to Bayesian missing data problems, the idea of collapsing suggests skipping the steps of sampling parameter(s) values in standard data augmentation. By doing this, we obtain a predictive update version of the Gibbs sampler. A procedure of calculating the posterior odds ratio via the collapsed Gibbs sampler when incomplete observations are involved is presented.

  abstract = {In modern applications, statisticians are faced with integrating heterogeneous data modalities relevant for an inference, prediction, or decision problem. In such circumstances, it is convenient to use a graphical model to represent the statistical dependencies, via a set of connected `modules', each relating to a specific data modality, and drawing on specific domain expertise in their development. In principle, given data, the conventional statistical update then allows for coherent uncertainty quantification and information propagation through and across the modules. However, misspecification of any module can contaminate the estimate and update of others, often in unpredictable ways. In various settings, particularly when certain modules are trusted more than others, practitioners have preferred to avoid learning with the full model in favor of approaches that restrict the information propagation between modules, for example by restricting propagation to only particular directions along the edges of the graph. In this article, we investigate why these modular approaches might be preferable to the full model in misspecified settings. We propose principled criteria to choose between modular and full-model approaches. The question arises in many applied settings, including large stochastic dynamical systems, meta-analysis, epidemiological models, air pollution models, pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics, and causal inference with propensity scores.},

In scenarios where data are assumed independent, various approaches to scale up the MetropolisHastings algorithm in a Bayesian inference context have been recently proposed in machine learning and computational statistics. These approaches can be grouped into two categories: divide-and-conquer approaches and, subsampling-based algorithms. The aims of this article are as follows. First, we present a comprehensive review of the existing literature, commenting on the underlying assumptions and theoretical guarantees of each method. Second, by leveraging our understanding of these limitations, we propose an original subsampling-based approach relying on a control variate method which samples under regularity conditions from a distribution provably close to the posterior distribution of interest, yet can require less than O(n) data point likelihood evaluations at each iteration for certain statistical models in favourable scenarios. Finally, we emphasize that we have only been able so far to propose subsampling-based methods which display good performance in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation of the target posterior distribution is excellent. It remains an open challenge to develop such methods in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation is poor.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of protein subcellular localization assists in the elucidation of protein function and understanding of different biological mechanisms that occur at discrete subcellular niches. Organelle-centric proteomics enables localization of thousands of proteins simultaneously. Although such techniques have successfully allowed organelle protein catalogues to be achieved, they rely on the purification or significant enrichment of the organelle of interest, which is not achievable for many organelles. Incomplete separation of organelles leads to false discoveries, with erroneous assignments. Proteomics methods that measure the distribution patterns of specific organelle markers along density gradients are able to assign proteins of unknown localization based on comigration with known organelle markers, without the need for organelle purification. These methods are greatly enhanced when coupled to sophisticated computational tools. Here we apply and compare multiple approaches to establish a high-confidence data set of Arabidopsis root tissue trans-Golgi network (TGN) proteins. The method employed involves immunoisolations of the TGN, coupled to probability-based organelle proteomics techniques. Specifically, the technique known as LOPIT (localization of organelle protein by isotope tagging), couples density centrifugation with quantitative mass-spectometry-based proteomics using isobaric labeling and targeted methods with semisupervised machine learning methods. We demonstrate that while the immunoisolation method gives rise to a significant data set, the approach is unable to distinguish cargo proteins and persistent contaminants from full-time residents of the TGN. The LOPIT approach, however, returns information about many subcellular niches simultaneously and the steady-state location of proteins. Importantly, therefore, it is able to dissect proteins present in more than one organelle and cargo proteins en route to other cellular destinations from proteins whose steady-state location favors the TGN. Using this approach, we present a robust list of Arabidopsis TGN proteins.},

The method performs bottom-up hierarchical clustering, using a Dirichlet Process (infinite mixture) to model uncertainty in the data and Bayesian model selection to decide at each step which clusters to merge.
Conclusion: Biologically plausible results are presented from a well studied data set: expression profiles of A. thaliana subjected to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses.

  abstract = {The Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) is a ubiquitous, flexible Bayesian nonparametric statistical model. However, full probabilistic inference in this model is analytically intractable, so that computationally intensive techniques such as Gibbs sampling are required. As a result, DPMM-based methods, which have considerable potential, are restricted to applications in which computational resources and time for inference is plentiful. For example, they would not be practical for digital signal processing on embedded hardware, where computational resources are at a serious premium. Here, we develop a simplified yet statistically rigorous approximate maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference algorithm for DPMMs. This algorithm is as simple as DP-means clustering, solves the MAP problem as well as Gibbs sampling, while requiring only a fraction of the computational effort.\textdagger{} Unlike related small variance asymptotics (SVA), our method is non-degenerate and so inherits the ``rich get richer'' property of the Dirichlet process. It also retains a non-degenerate closedform likelihood which enables out-of-sample calculations and the use of standard tools such as cross-validation. We illustrate the benefits of our algorithm on a range of examples and contrast it to variational, SVA and sampling approaches from both a computational complexity perspective as well as in terms of clustering performance. We demonstrate the wide applicabiity of our approach by presenting an approximate MAP inference method for the infinite hidden Markov model whose performance contrasts favorably with a recently proposed hybrid SVA approach. Similarly, we show how our algorithm can applied to a semiparametric mixed-effects regression model where the random effects distribution is modelled using an infinite mixture model, as used in longitudinal progression modelling in population health science. Finally, we propose directions for future research on approximate MAP inference in Bayesian nonparametrics.},

(2) It uses a model-based criterion to decide on merging clusters rather than an ad-hoc distance metric. (3) Bayesian hypothesis testing is used to decide which merges are advantageous and to output the recommended depth of the tree. (4) The algorithm can be interpreted as a novel fast bottom-up approximate inference method for a Dirichlet process (i.e. countably infinite) mixture model (DPM). It provides a new lower bound on the marginal likelihood of a DPM by summing over exponentially many clusterings of the data in polynomial time. We describe procedures for learning the model hyperparameters, computing the predictive distribution, and extensions to the algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate useful properties of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {The sparse pseudo-input Gaussian process (SPGP) is a new approximation method for speeding up GP regression in the case of a large number of data points N . The approximation is controlled by the gradient optimization of a small set of M `pseudoinputs', thereby reducing complexity from O(N 3) to O(M 2N ). One limitation of the SPGP is that this optimization space becomes impractically big for high dimensional data sets. This paper addresses this limitation by performing automatic dimensionality reduction. A projection of the input space to a low dimensional space is learned in a supervised manner, alongside the pseudoinputs, which now live in this reduced space. The paper also investigates the suitability of the SPGP for modeling data with inputdependent noise. A further extension of the model is made to make it even more powerful in this regard \textendash{} we learn an uncertainty parameter for each pseudo-input. The combination of sparsity, reduced dimension, and input-dependent noise makes it possible to apply GPs to much larger and more complex data sets than was previously practical.

We show results for inference with two motivating data sets: a large set of electronic health records (EHR) and a bank telemarketing dataset. We find interesting clusters and favorable classification performance relative to other widely used competing classifiers.},

  title = {A Comparative Review of Variable Selection Techniques for Covariate Dependent {{Dirichlet}} Process Mixture Models},
  abstract = {Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) models have been increasingly employed to specify random partition models that take into account possible patterns within the covariates. Furthermore, to deal with large numbers of covariates, methods for selecting the most important covariates have been proposed. Commonly, the covariates are chosen either for their importance in determining the clustering of the observations or for their effect on the level of a response variable (when a regression model is specified). Typically both strategies involve the specification of latent indicators that regulate the inclusion of the covariates in the model. Common examples involve the use of spike and slab prior distributions. In this work we review the most relevant DPM models that include covariate information in the induced partition of the observations and we focus on available variable selection techniques for these models. We highlight the main features of each model and demonstrate them in simulations and in a real data application.},

  abstract = {First-generation magnetic random access memories based on anisotropic magnetoresistance required magnetic fields for both writing and reading. Modern all-electrical read/write memories use instead non-relativistic spin-transport connecting the storing magnetic layer with a reference ferromagnet. Recent studies have focused on electrical manipulation of magnetic moments by relativistic spin-torques requiring no reference ferromagnet. Here we report the observation of a counterpart magnetoresistance effect in such a relativistic system which allows us to electrically detect the sign of the magnetization without an auxiliary magnetic field or ferromagnet. We observe the effect in a geometry in which the magnetization of a uniaxial (Ga,Mn)As epilayer is set either parallel or antiparallel to a current-induced non-equilibrium spin polarization of carriers. In our structure, this linear-in-current magnetoresistance reaches 0.2$\backslash$\% at current density of \$10\^6\$ A cm\$\^\{-2\}\$.},
