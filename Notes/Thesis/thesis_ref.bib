We may use these, for example, when modelling observations taken over time on students who are grouped into classes that are grouped into schools that are grouped into districts. If each of the distributions of the random effects is Gaussian and if the disturbance term at the lowest level of grouping is also Gaussian it is straightforward to define a likelihood for the fixed effects and the parameters defining the random effects distribution. We show that by expressing the random effects distribution in terms of relative precision factors and using matrix decompositions, this likelihood can be profiled and can be compactly expressed. The same decompositions provide rapid evaluation of the profiled log-restricted-likelihood for REML estimation.},

The FvCB model was modified by adding a sub-model for Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) activation and validating the parameters for temperature dependency of Vcmax and Jmax. Values of parameters for temperature dependency of Vcmax and Jmax were validated and adjusted based on data of the photosynthesis response to temperature. Parameter estimation was based on measurements under a wide range of environmental conditions, providing parameters with broad validity. The simultaneous estimation method and the nonlinear mixed effects model were applied to ensure the accuracy of the parameter estimation. The FvCB parameters, Vcmax, Jmax, \k{} (the efficiency of light energy conversion), \^A (the curvature of light response of electron transport), and Rd (the non-photorespiratory CO2 release) were estimated and validated on a dataset from two other years. Observations and predictions matched well (R2 = 0.94). We conclude that incorporating a sub-model of Rubisco activation improved the FvCB model through predicting light dependency of carboxylation rate; and that estimating Vcmax, Jmax, \k, \^A, and Rd requires data sets of both CO2 and light response curves.},

  abstract = {\textdagger{} Background and Aims Plants use diffuse light more efficiently than direct light. However, experimental comparisons between diffuse and direct light have been obscured by co-occurring differences in environmental conditions (e.g. light intensity). This study aims to analyse the factors that contribute to an increase in crop photosynthesis in diffuse light and to quantify their relative contribution under different levels of diffuseness at similar light intensities. The hypothesis is that the enhancement of crop photosynthesis in diffuse light results not only from the direct effects of more uniform vertical and horizontal light distribution in the crop canopy, but also from crop physiological and morphological acclimation. \textdagger{} Methods Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) crops were grown in three greenhouse compartments that were covered by glass with different degrees of light diffuseness (0, 45 and 71 \% of the direct light being converted into diffuse light) while maintaining similar light transmission. Measurements of horizontal and vertical photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) distribution in the crop, leaf photosynthesis light response curves and leaf area index (LAI) were used to quantify each factor's contribution to an increase in crop photosynthesis in diffuse light. In addition, leaf temperature, photoinhibition, and leaf biochemical and anatomical properties were studied. \textdagger{} Key Results The highest degree of light diffuseness (71 \%) increased the calculated crop photosynthesis by 7.2 \%. This effect was mainly attributed to a more uniform horizontal (33 \% of the total effect) and vertical PPFD distribution (21 \%) in the crop. In addition, plants acclimated to the high level of diffuseness by gaining a higher photosynthetic capacity of leaves in the middle of the crop and a higher LAI, which contributed 23 and 13 \%, respectively, to the total increase in crop photosynthesis in diffuse light. Moreover, diffuse light resulted in lower leaf temperatures and less photoinhibition at the top of the canopy when global irradiance was high. \textdagger{} Conclusions Diffuse light enhanced crop photosynthesis. A more uniform horizontal PPFD distribution played the most important role in this enhancement, and a more uniform vertical PPFD distribution and higher leaf photosynthetic capacity contributed more to the enhancement of crop photosynthesis than did higher values of LAI.},

Methods for fitting a model to such data are briefly described. The method will fit the following parameters: Vcmax, J, TPU, Rd and gm [maximum carboxylation rate allowed by ribulose 1$\cdot$5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), rate of photosynthetic electron transport (based on NADPH requirement), triose phosphate use, day respiration and mesophyll conductance, respectively]. The method requires at least five data pairs of net CO2 assimilation (A) and [CO2] in the intercellular airspaces of the leaf (Ci) and requires users to indicate the presumed limiting factor. The output is (1) calculated CO2 partial pressure at the sites of carboxylation, Cc, (2) values for the five parameters at the measurement temperature and (3) values adjusted to 25 $^\circ$C to facilitate comparisons. Fitting this model is a way of exploring leaf level photosynthesis. However, interpreting leaf level photosynthesis in terms of underlying biochemistry and biophysics is subject to assumptions that hold to a greater or lesser degree, a major assumption being that all parts of the leaf are behaving in the same way at each instant.},

However, estimations of average gm by these methods are often unreliable either because the range of usable data is too narrow or because the estimations are very sensitive to measurement errors. We describe three method variants to estimate gm, for which a wider range of data are usable. They use curve-fitting techniques, which minimise the sum of squared model deviations from the data for A (CO2 assimilation rate) or for J (linear electron transport rate). Like the existing approaches, they are all based on common physiological principles assuming that electron transport limits A. The proposed variants were far less sensitive than the existing approaches to `measurement noise' either created randomly in the generated data set or inevitably existing in real data sets. Yet, the estimates of gm from the three variants differed by approximately 15\%. Moreover, for each variant, a stoichiometric uncertainty in linear electron transport-limited photosynthesis can cause another 15\% difference. Any estimation of gm using gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements should be considered with caution, especially when gm is high.},

  abstract = {Mesophyll diffusion conductance to CO2 (gm) is an important leaf characteristic determining the drawdown of CO2 from substomatal cavities (Ci) to chloroplasts (CC). Finite gm results in modifications in the shape of the net assimilation (A) versus Ci response curves, with the final outcome of reduced maximal carboxylase activity of Rubisco (Vcmax), and a greater ratio of the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport to Vcmax (Jmax/Vcmax) and alterations in mitochondrial respiration rate (Rd) when estimated from A/Ci responses without considering gm. The influence of different Farquhar et al. model parameterizations on daily photosynthesis under non-stressed (Ci kept constant throughout the day) and stressed conditions (mid-day reduction in Ci) was compared. The model was parameterized on the basis of A/CC curves and A/Ci curves using both the conventional fitting procedure (Vcmax and Rd fitted separately to the linear part of the response curve and Jmax to the saturating part) and a procedure that fitted all parameters simultaneously. The analyses demonstrated that A/Ci parameterizations overestimated daily assimilation by 6\textendash{}8\% for high gm values, while they underestimated if by up to 70\% for low gm values. Qualitative differences between the A/Ci and A/CC parameterizations were observed under stressed conditions, when underestimated Vcmax and overestimated Rd of A/Ci parameterizations resulted in excessive mid-day depression of photosynthesis. Comparison with measured diurnal assimilation rates in the Mediterranean sclerophyll species Quercus ilex under drought further supported this bias of A/Ci parameterizations. While A/Ci parameterization predicted negative carbon balance at mid-day, actual measurements and simulations with the A/CC approach yielded positive carbon gain under these conditions. In addition, overall variation captured by the best A/Ci parameterization was poor compared with the A/CC approach. This analysis strongly suggests that for correct parameterization of daily time-courses of photosynthesis under realistic field conditions, gm must be included in photosynthesis models.},

  volume = {78},
  abstract = {The PhOtosynthetic capacity of leaves is related to the nitrogen content primarily because the proteins of the Calvin cycle and thylakoids represent the majority of leaf nitrogen. To a first approximation, thylakoid nitrogen is proportional to the chlorophyll content (50 mol thylakoid N mol- \textasciitilde{} Chl). Within species there are strong linear relationships between nitrogen and both RuBP carboxylase and chlorophyll. With increasing nitrogen per unit leaf area, the proportion of total leaf nitrogen in the thylakoids remains the same while the proportion in soluble protein increases. In many species, growth under lower irradiance greatly increases the partitioning of nitrogen into chlorophyll and the thylakoids, while the electron transport capacity per unit of chlorophyll declines. If growth irradiance influences the relationship between photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen content, predicting nitrogen distribution between leaves in a canopy becomes more complicated. When both photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen content are expressed on the basis of leaf area, considerable variation in the photosynthetic capacity for a given leaf nitrogen content is found between species. The variation reflects different strategies of nitrogen partitioning, the electron transport capacity per unit of chlorophyll and the specific activity of RuBP carboxylase. Survival in certain environments clearly does not require maximising photosynthetic capacity for a given leaf nitrogen content. Species that flourish in the shade partition relatively more nitrogen into the thylakoids, although this is associated with lower photosynthetic capacity per unit of nitrogen.},

Modern highthroughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct\textemdash{}but often complementary\textemdash{}information. We present a Bayesian method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets, which we refer to as MDI (Multiple Dataset Integration). MDI can integrate information from a wide range of different datasets and data types simultaneously (including the ability to model time series data explicitly using Gaussian processes). Each dataset is modelled using a Dirichlet-multinomial allocation (DMA) mixture model, with dependencies between these models captured through parameters that describe the agreement among the datasets. Results: Using a set of six artificially constructed time series datasets, we show that MDI is able to integrate a significant number of datasets simultaneously, and that it successfully captures the underlying structural similarity between the datasets. We also analyse a variety of real Saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets. In the two-dataset case, we show that MDI's performance is comparable with the present state-of-the-art. We then move beyond the capabilities of current approaches and integrate gene expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation\textendash{}chip and protein\textendash{}protein interaction data, to identify a set of protein complexes for which genes are co-regulated during the cell cycle. Comparisons to other unsupervised data integration techniques\textemdash{}as well as to non-integrative approaches\textemdash{}demonstrate that MDI is competitive, while also providing information that would be difficult or impossible to extract using other methods.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are often deemed too computationally intensive to be of any practical use for big data applications, and in particular for inference on datasets containing a large number n of individual data points, also known as tall datasets. In scenarios where data are assumed independent, various approaches to scale up the MetropolisHastings algorithm in a Bayesian inference context have been recently proposed in machine learning and computational statistics. These approaches can be grouped into two categories: divide-and-conquer approaches and, subsampling-based algorithms. The aims of this article are as follows. First, we present a comprehensive review of the existing literature, commenting on the underlying assumptions and theoretical guarantees of each method. Second, by leveraging our understanding of these limitations, we propose an original subsampling-based approach relying on a control variate method which samples under regularity conditions from a distribution provably close to the posterior distribution of interest, yet can require less than O(n) data point likelihood evaluations at each iteration for certain statistical models in favourable scenarios. Finally, we emphasize that we have only been able so far to propose subsampling-based methods which display good performance in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation of the target posterior distribution is excellent. It remains an open challenge to develop such methods in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation is poor.},

The method performs bottom-up hierarchical clustering, using a Dirichlet Process (infinite mixture) to model uncertainty in the data and Bayesian model selection to decide at each step which clusters to merge.
Conclusion: Biologically plausible results are presented from a well studied data set: expression profiles of A. thaliana subjected to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. Our method avoids several limitations of traditional methods, for example how many clusters there should be and how to choose a principled distance metric.},

  abstract = {The Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) is a ubiquitous, flexible Bayesian nonparametric statistical model. However, full probabilistic inference in this model is analytically intractable, so that computationally intensive techniques such as Gibbs sampling are required. As a result, DPMM-based methods, which have considerable potential, are restricted to applications in which computational resources and time for inference is plentiful. For example, they would not be practical for digital signal processing on embedded hardware, where computational resources are at a serious premium. Here, we develop a simplified yet statistically rigorous approximate maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference algorithm for DPMMs. This algorithm is as simple as DP-means clustering, solves the MAP problem as well as Gibbs sampling, while requiring only a fraction of the computational effort.\textdagger{} Unlike related small variance asymptotics (SVA), our method is non-degenerate and so inherits the ``rich get richer'' property of the Dirichlet process. It also retains a non-degenerate closedform likelihood which enables out-of-sample calculations and the use of standard tools such as cross-validation. We illustrate the benefits of our algorithm on a range of examples and contrast it to variational, SVA and sampling approaches from both a computational complexity perspective as well as in terms of clustering performance. We demonstrate the wide applicabiity of our approach by presenting an approximate MAP inference method for the infinite hidden Markov model whose performance contrasts favorably with a recently proposed hybrid SVA approach. Similarly, we show how our algorithm can applied to a semiparametric mixed-effects regression model where the random effects distribution is modelled using an infinite mixture model, as used in longitudinal progression modelling in population health science. Finally, we propose directions for future research on approximate MAP inference in Bayesian nonparametrics.},

This algorithm has several advantages over traditional distance-based agglomerative clustering algorithms. (1) It defines a probabilistic model of the data which can be used to compute the predictive distribution of a test point and the probability of it belonging to any of the existing clusters in the tree. (2) It uses a model-based criterion to decide on merging clusters rather than an ad-hoc distance metric. (3) Bayesian hypothesis testing is used to decide which merges are advantageous and to output the recommended depth of the tree. (4) The algorithm can be interpreted as a novel fast bottom-up approximate inference method for a Dirichlet process (i.e. countably infinite) mixture model (DPM). It provides a new lower bound on the marginal likelihood of a DPM by summing over exponentially many clusterings of the data in polynomial time. We describe procedures for learning the model hyperparameters, computing the predictive distribution, and extensions to the algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate useful properties of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {The sparse pseudo-input Gaussian process (SPGP) is a new approximation method for speeding up GP regression in the case of a large number of data points N . The approximation is controlled by the gradient optimization of a small set of M `pseudoinputs', thereby reducing complexity from O(N 3) to O(M 2N ). One limitation of the SPGP is that this optimization space becomes impractically big for high dimensional data sets. This paper addresses this limitation by performing automatic dimensionality reduction. A projection of the input space to a low dimensional space is learned in a supervised manner, alongside the pseudoinputs, which now live in this reduced space. The paper also investigates the suitability of the SPGP for modeling data with inputdependent noise. A further extension of the model is made to make it even more powerful in this regard \textendash{} we learn an uncertainty parameter for each pseudo-input. The combination of sparsity, reduced dimension, and input-dependent noise makes it possible to apply GPs to much larger and more complex data sets than was previously practical.

An appealing aspect of this approach is that computations are relatively easy. In this paper, we examine the predictive performance of these models with an increasing number of covariates. Even for a moderate number of covariates, we find that the likelihood for x tends to dominate the posterior of the latent random partition, degrading the predictive performance of the model. To overcome this, we suggest using a different nonparametric prior, namely an enriched Dirichlet process. Our proposal maintains a simple allocation rule, so that computations remain relatively simple.

Furthermore, to deal with large numbers of covariates, methods for selecting the most important covariates have been proposed. Commonly, the covariates are chosen either for their importance in determining the clustering of the observations or for their effect on the level of a response variable (when a regression model is specified). Typically both strategies involve the specification of latent indicators that regulate the inclusion of the covariates in the model. Common examples involve the use of spike and slab prior distributions. In this work we review the most relevant DPM models that include covariate information in the induced partition of the observations and we focus on available variable selection techniques for these models.

  doi = {https://doi-org.ezproxy.library.wur.nl/10.1007/BF00035838},
  abstract = {Current models of C3 photosynthesis incorporate a phosphate limitation to carboxylation which arises when the capacity for starch and sucrose synthesis fails to match the capacity for the production of triose phosphates in the Calvin cycle. As a result, the release of inorganic phosphate in the chloroplast stroma fails to keep pace with its rate of sequestration into triose phosphate, and phosphate becomes limiting to photosynthesis. Such a model predicts that when phosphate is limiting, assimilation becomes insensitive to both CO 2 and 02, and is thus incapable of explaining the experimental observation that assimilation, under phosphate-limited conditions, frequently exhibits reversed sensitivity to both CO 2 and 02, i.e., increasing 0 2 stimulates assimilation and increasing CO 2 inhibits assimilation. We propose a model which explains reversed sensitivity to CO 2 and 0 2 by invoking the net release of phosphate in the photorespiratory oxidation cycle. In order for this to occur, some fraction of the glycollate carbon which leaves the stroma and which is recycled to the chloroplast by the photorespiratory pathway as glycerate must remain in the cytosol, perhaps in the form of amino acids. In that case, phosphate normally used in the stromal glycerate kinase reaction to generate PGA from glycerate is made available for photophosphorylation, stimulating RuBP regeneration and assimilation. The model is parameterized for data obtained on soybean and cotton, and model behavior in response to CO2, 02, and light is demonstrated.},

We studied this 'Kok effect' in attached sunflower (Helianthus annaus L. cv IS894) leaves using gas exchange techniques. The effect was present even though respiration was constant in the dark. It was observed at a similar photon flux density (7 to 11 micromole photons per square meter per second absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) despite a wide range of light compensation points as well as rates of photosynthesis. The effect was not apparent when photorespiration was inhibited at low P02 (1 kilopascal), but this result was complicated because dark respiration was quite Orsensitive and was partially suppressed under these conditions. The Kok effect was observed at saturating pCO2 and, therefore, could not be explained by a change in photorespiration. Instead, the magnitude of the effect varied as dark respiration varied in a single leaf, and was minimized when dark respiration was minimized, indicating that a partial suppression of dark respiration by light is responsible. Quantum yields measured at photon flux densities between 0 and 7 to 11 micromole photons per square meter per second, therefore, represent the combined yields of photosynthesis and of the suppression of a component of dark respiration by light. This leads to an overestimate of the quantum yield of photosynthesis. In view of these results, quantum yields of photosynthesis must be measured (a) when respiration is constant in the dark, and (b) when dark respiration has been inhibited either at low P02 to eliminate most of the light-induced suppression of dark respiration or at photon flux densities above that required to saturate the light-induced suppression of dark respiration. Significant errors in quantum yields of photosynthesis can result in leaves exhibiting this respiratory behavior if these principles are not followed.},

  abstract = {Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) represents the difference between carbon assimilated through photosynthesis, or gross primary productivity (GPP), and carbon released via ecosystem respiration (ER). NEE, measured via eddy covariance and chamber techniques, must be partitioned into these fluxes to accurately describe and understand the carbon dynamics of an ecosystem. GPP and daytime ER may be significantly overestimated if the light inhibition of foliar mitochondrial respiration, or ``Kok effect,'' is not accurately estimated and further integrated into ecosystem measurements. The light inhibition of respiration, a composite effect of multiple cellular pathways, is reported to cause between 25-100\% inhibition of foliar mitochondrial respiration, and for this reason needs to be considered when estimating larger carbon fluxes. Partitioning of respiration between autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration, and applying these scaled respiratory fluxes to the ecosystem-level proves to be difficult, and the integration of light inhibition into single and continuous measures of ecosystem respiration will require new interpretations and analysis of carbon exchange in terrestrial ecosystems.},
