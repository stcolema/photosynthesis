  abstract = {The aims of this paper was to modify the photosynthesis model of Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry (FvCB) to be able to predict light dependency of the carboxylation capacity (Vc) and to improve the prediction of temperature dependency of the maximum carboxylation capacity (Vcmax) and the maximum electron transport rate (Jmax). The FvCB model was modified by adding a sub-model for Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) activation and validating the parameters for temperature dependency of Vcmax and Jmax. Values of parameters for temperature dependency of Vcmax and Jmax were validated and adjusted based on data of the photosynthesis response to temperature. Parameter estimation was based on measurements under a wide range of environmental conditions, providing parameters with broad validity. The simultaneous estimation method and the nonlinear mixed effects model were applied to ensure the accuracy of the parameter estimation. The FvCB parameters, Vcmax, Jmax, \k{} (the efficiency of light energy conversion), {\^A} (the curvature of light response of electron transport), and Rd (the non-photorespiratory CO2 release) were estimated and validated on a dataset from two other years. Observations and predictions matched well (R2 = 0.94). We conclude that incorporating a sub-model of Rubisco activation improved the FvCB model through predicting light dependency of carboxylation rate; and that estimating Vcmax, Jmax, \k, {\^A}, and Rd requires data sets of both CO2 and light response curves.},

To do this successfully it is important to improve the modelling of temperature dependencies of CO2 assimilation and gain better understanding of internal CO2 diffusion limitations. Despite these shortcomings steadystate models of photosynthesis provide simple easy to use tools for thought experiments to explore photosynthetic pathway changes such as redirecting photorespiratory CO2, inserting bicarbonate pumps into C3 chloroplasts or inserting C4 photosynthesis into rice. Here a number of models derived from the C3 model by Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry are discussed and compared.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic responses to carbon dioxide concentration can provide data on a number of important parameters related to leaf physiology. Methods for fitting a model to such data are briefly described. The method will fit the following parameters: Vcmax, J, TPU, Rd and gm [maximum carboxylation rate allowed by ribulose 1$\cdot$5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), rate of photosynthetic electron transport (based on NADPH requirement), triose phosphate use, day respiration and mesophyll conductance, respectively]. The method requires at least five data pairs of net CO2 assimilation (A) and [CO2] in the intercellular airspaces of the leaf (Ci) and requires users to indicate the presumed limiting factor. The output is (1) calculated CO2 partial pressure at the sites of carboxylation, Cc, (2) values for the five parameters at the measurement temperature and (3) values adjusted to 25 $^\circ$C to facilitate comparisons. Fitting this model is a way of exploring leaf level photosynthesis. However, interpreting leaf level photosynthesis in terms of underlying biochemistry and biophysics is subject to assumptions that hold to a greater or lesser degree, a major assumption being that all parts of the leaf are behaving in the same way at each instant.},

  abstract = {Existing methods to estimate the mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion (gm) are often based on combined gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. However, estimations of average gm by these methods are often unreliable either because the range of usable data is too narrow or because the estimations are very sensitive to measurement errors. We describe three method variants to estimate gm, for which a wider range of data are usable. They use curve-fitting techniques, which minimise the sum of squared model deviations from the data for A (CO2 assimilation rate) or for J (linear electron transport rate). Like the existing approaches, they are all based on common physiological principles assuming that electron transport limits A. The proposed variants were far less sensitive than the existing approaches to `measurement noise' either created randomly in the generated data set or inevitably existing in real data sets. Yet, the estimates of gm from the three variants differed by approximately 15\%. Moreover, for each variant, a stoichiometric uncertainty in linear electron transport-limited photosynthesis can cause another 15\% difference. Any estimation of gm using gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements should be considered with caution, especially when gm is high.},

  doi = {10.1093/jxb/erp063},
  abstract = {Mesophyll diffusion conductance to CO2 (gm) is an important leaf characteristic determining the drawdown of CO2 from substomatal cavities (Ci) to chloroplasts (CC). Finite gm results in modifications in the shape of the net assimilation (A) versus Ci response curves, with the final outcome of reduced maximal carboxylase activity of Rubisco (Vcmax), and a greater ratio of the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport to Vcmax (Jmax/Vcmax) and alterations in mitochondrial respiration rate (Rd) when estimated from A/Ci responses without considering gm. The influence of different Farquhar et al. model parameterizations on daily photosynthesis under non-stressed (Ci kept constant throughout the day) and stressed conditions (mid-day reduction in Ci) was compared. The model was parameterized on the basis of A/CC curves and A/Ci curves using both the conventional fitting procedure (Vcmax and Rd fitted separately to the linear part of the response curve and Jmax to the saturating part) and a procedure that fitted all parameters simultaneously. The analyses demonstrated that A/Ci parameterizations overestimated daily assimilation by 6\textendash{}8\% for high gm values, while they underestimated if by up to 70\% for low gm values. Qualitative differences between the A/Ci and A/CC parameterizations were observed under stressed conditions, when underestimated Vcmax and overestimated Rd of A/Ci parameterizations resulted in excessive mid-day depression of photosynthesis. Comparison with measured diurnal assimilation rates in the Mediterranean sclerophyll species Quercus ilex under drought further supported this bias of A/Ci parameterizations. While A/Ci parameterization predicted negative carbon balance at mid-day, actual measurements and simulations with the A/CC approach yielded positive carbon gain under these conditions. In addition, overall variation captured by the best A/Ci parameterization was poor compared with the A/CC approach. This analysis strongly suggests that for correct parameterization of daily time-courses of photosynthesis under realistic field conditions, gm must be included in photosynthesis models.},

@article{EvansPhotosynthesisnitrogenrelationships,
  title = {Photosynthesis and Nitrogen Relationships in Leaves of {{Ca}} Plants},
  abstract = {The PhOtosynthetic capacity of leaves is related to the nitrogen content primarily because the proteins of the Calvin cycle and thylakoids represent the majority of leaf nitrogen. To a first approximation, thylakoid nitrogen is proportional to the chlorophyll content (50 mol thylakoid N mol- \textasciitilde{} Chl). Within species there are strong linear relationships between nitrogen and both RuBP carboxylase and chlorophyll. With increasing nitrogen per unit leaf area, the proportion of total leaf nitrogen in the thylakoids remains the same while the proportion in soluble protein increases. In many species, growth under lower irradiance greatly increases the partitioning of nitrogen into chlorophyll and the thylakoids, while the electron transport capacity per unit of chlorophyll declines. If growth irradiance influences the relationship between photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen content, predicting nitrogen distribution between leaves in a canopy becomes more complicated. When both photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen content are expressed on the basis of leaf area, considerable variation in the photosynthetic capacity for a given leaf nitrogen content is found between species. The variation reflects different strategies of nitrogen partitioning, the electron transport capacity per unit of chlorophyll and the specific activity of RuBP carboxylase. Survival in certain environments clearly does not require maximising photosynthetic capacity for a given leaf nitrogen content. Species that flourish in the shade partition relatively more nitrogen into the thylakoids, although this is associated with lower photosynthetic capacity per unit of nitrogen.},
